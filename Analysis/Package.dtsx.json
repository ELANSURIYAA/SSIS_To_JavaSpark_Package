"Join Handling Strategy": "No joins present, minimal adjustments needed.",
"Complex Ops Handling": "Handle error logging using Spark's logging framework.",
"Output Refactoring": "Rewrite OUTPUTs to HDFS or Parquet using Spark DataFrame write operations."
},
"5. Optimization Techniques in Spark": {
"Join Optimization": "Not applicable.",
"Partitioning Strategy": "Partition datasets based on key fields for efficient processing.",
