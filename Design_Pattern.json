      "frequency": "1 occurrence",
      "percentage": "100%",
      "description": "This pattern involves reading from a database table source (ST), writing to an API target (TA), implementing data quality checks and rejection handling (DQ), and performing insert operations for error logging (DI)",

  "detailed_patterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "ST-TA-DQ-DI",
      "description": "This pattern reads data from SQL database tables (OrderActivityUpdates), sends it to Salesforce API (Order_Activity__c object), handles errors with rejection paths, and logs failures to error tables (OrderActivitySyncErrorLog)",
      "spark_suitability": "High - Spark is well-suited for this ETL pattern with its robust API connectivity and error handling capabilities",
      "recommendations": [
        "Use Spark DataFrames to read from source tables with optimized partitioning based on ExtOrderID__c field",
        "Implement Spark's error handling with try-catch blocks around the Salesforce API calls to capture and redirect failed records",
        "Use Spark's foreachBatch or foreachPartition for API calls to Salesforce to control parallelism and avoid API throttling",
        "Implement circuit breaker patterns for API resilience to handle temporary Salesforce API unavailability",
        "Use Spark's repartition() before writing error records to optimize the insert operations to error log tables",
        "Implement checkpointing for long-running jobs to enable recovery from failures"
