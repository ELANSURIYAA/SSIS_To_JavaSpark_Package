    "1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost": {
      "Cluster Configuration": {
        "Number of Executors": 4,
        "Executor Memory": "16 GB",
        "Driver Memory": "8 GB"
      },
      "Approximate Data Volume Processed": {
        "Input Data": "100 GB (salesforce.OrderActivityUpdates) + 150 GB (salesforce.OrderActivitySyncErrorLog)",
        "Output Data": "10â€“15 GB (processed data volume)"
      },
      "Time Taken for Each Phase": {
        "Shuffle-heavy JOINs": "Not applicable",
        "Wide Transforms (e.g., ROLLUP, DENORMALIZE)": "1 hour",
        "Output Writes": "30 minutes"
      },
      "Cost Model": {
        "Pricing Model (e.g., DBU, vCPU Hour)": "Databricks DBU cost per hour ($0.15 - $0.75)",
        "Total Runtime Cost": "Estimated between $45 and $225 for the entire job based on cluster configuration and runtime duration"
      },
      "Justification": [
        "Cluster configuration ensures efficient processing of the estimated data volume.",
        "Minimal joins and transforms reduce runtime costs.",
        "Output writes are optimized using Spark's DataFrame write operations."
